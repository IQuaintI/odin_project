/*
    Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
    However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. 
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

    5. If the current number is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
    6. Otherwise print the current number

/*
    1Q. What are the three stages in the problem solving process?
    1A. Understand, Plan, and Execute

    2Q. Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?
    2A. If you don't understand the problem you can't solve it.

    3Q. What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?
    3A. Break the problem down into smaller pieces and try to solve each piece individually.

    4Q. What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?
    4A. Consider the inputs and outputs, consider the edge cases, and consider the constraints.

    5Q. What is an algorithm?
    5A. A set of instructions for solving a problem.

    6Q. What is pseudocode?
    6A. Writing out the steps of an algorithm in plain English.

    7Q. What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
    7A. It makes the problem more manageable and it helps prevent burnout
