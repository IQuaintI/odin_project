Destructuring is a way to extract multiple values from a data structure (such as an array) into separate variables. It is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

parts[] and parts[0] are equivalent. parts[1] is the second element of the array, parts[2] is the third element, and so on. The length of the array is parts.length.

In this case parts[0] is `John` and parts[1] is `Doe`.
